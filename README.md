# MIPS-Single-Cycle-Processor


## Description
This project is a simulation of a single-cycled processor based on the MIPS architecture. The processor was written using Verilog and simulated using Vivado 2018.1; it supports a limited instruction set including load, store, branch, jump, and R-type instructions. More supported instructions and overflow handling are planned additions for the future.

**__The below figure gives an overview of the datapath used in the processor.__**
